# Faster R-CNN model for room label detection in floorplan images using Detectron2

This project focuses on detecting **room labels** in architectural floorplans using Faster R-CNN implemented via Detectron2. The goal is to automate semantic region recognition to support digital workflows in real estate, interior design, and spatial analytics.

## üìå Project Objective

Architectural floorplans contain rich semantic information, but manual interpretation of room labels is slow and error-prone. This project builds a robust object detection pipeline to identify room labels from floorplan images, enabling:

- Faster semantic parsing of architectural layouts  
- Improved accuracy in room classification and zoning  
- Scalable integration into downstream planning or analytics tools

## üß© Core Workflow

### Data Preparation
- Floorplan images annotated in COCO format  
- Focused on room label regions with bounding boxes and category IDs  
- Supports multilingual labels (e.g., "Kitchen", "Ba√±o", "„Éà„Ç§„É¨")

### Model Training
- Trained a Faster R-CNN model using Detectron2  
- Leveraged GPU acceleration via Google Colab  
- Tuned hyperparameters for domain-specific performance

### Inference & Visualization
- Ran predictions on unseen test images  
- Visualized bounding boxes over room label regions  
- Saved outputs for qualitative review

### Evaluation
- Measured performance using COCO metrics  
- Focused on Average Precision (AP) for room label detection  
- Validated consistency across varied floorplan styles and languages
